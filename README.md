# PIP-DAY-1
# dynamic Array program explaination :-
# 1.This code creates an array of arrays arrays with a length of 'numArrays' (in this case, 6). It then initializes a currentArrayIndex variable to 0.
# 2.The 'const element' defines an array of elements that contains a mix of letters and numbers. It then loops through each element in elements and adds it to the current array (retrieved from arrays using currentArrayIndex). # 3.It then increments currentArrayIndex to point to the next array in arrays, wrapping around to the beginning of arrays when it reaches the end, using the modulus operator.
# 4.Finally, it prints out the contents of each array .


# Note :- The elements array is split across the arrays , with each array receiving every sixth element (starting from the first element in elements).
